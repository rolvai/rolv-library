**Sparse Matrix Acceleration for AI, Mining, Mobile & Beyond**

ROLV is a patent-pending software library that delivers groundbreaking speed and energy efficiency for sparse data workloads. Built on proprietary mathematical frameworks, ROLV achieves up to **160x faster performance** and **99.31% energy savings** compared to leading sparse libraries like cuSPARSE and hipSPARSE—without hardware tuning.

## 🚀 Highlights

- **Speed**: Up to 145.71x faster than cuSPARSE (NVIDIA), 121.77x faster than hipSPARSE (AMD), and 160x faster than JAX sparse on TPU.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Up to 99.31% less power consumption in sparse matrix operations.
- **Hardware-Agnostic**: Compatible with binary, quantum, optical, DNA, and emerging computing platforms.
- **Use Cases**: AI/ML training & inference, cryptocurrency mining, mobile computing, distributed systems.

## 📐 Core Concepts

ROLV uses reinforcement learning–orchestrated sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) and dynamic complexity bounds to skip zero operations and reduce FLOPs. This enables:

- Efficient sparse matrix multiplication
- Optimized SHA-256 hashing for mining
- Battery-saving ML inference on mobile
- Scalable performance across heterogeneous hardware

## 🧠 Patent Framework

ROLV is protected by a fast-track parent patent and four Continuation-in-Part (CIP) filings:

1. **Parent**: Unified sparse optimization framework
2. **CIP 1**: Distributed Hybrid Format (DHF) for parallel processing
3. **CIP 2**: Mining optimization
4. **CIP 3**: Mobile battery efficiency
5. **CIP 4**: Generalized sparse acceleration

## 📊 Benchmarks

Validated on Google Colab and RunPod with matrices up to 20,000×20,000:

| Platform       | Speedup vs cuSPARSE | Energy Savings |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| NVIDIA B200    | 145.71x             | 99.31%         |
| AMD MI300X     | 121.77x             | 99.18%         |
| Google TPU v6e | 160x (vs JAX sparse)| —              |
